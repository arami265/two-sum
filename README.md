# two-sum

This program returns integer two sum solutions in a few forms.
The first runs in O(n) time, as it returns the first solution it encounters and at maximum will check every number once.
The second two run in ~n time as they check for all possible pairs in the set, and thus will surely check each number once.

### Credit
The general algorithm itself is from studying Coderbyte's [solution](https://coderbyte.com/algorithm/two-sum-problem).


### TODO:
  - Deal with data types other than integers
  - Deal with specific forms of input (duplicates, no duplicates, etc)
